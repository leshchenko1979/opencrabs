//! Sub-agent tool-registry construction.
//!
//! Typed agent roles (`AgentType`) were removed (#1173): a child is now
//! either read-restricted or not, decided solely by the parent's explicit
//! `read_only` grant at spawn time. The old per-type allow-lists and canned
//! system-prompt preambles are gone — restricted children get their tool set
//! from [`restrict_registry_to_read_only`](crate::brain::tools::plan_gate::restrict_registry_to_read_only)
//! (#649) and one factual capability line instead of role-play text.
//!
//! Deprecated `agent_type` values from the typed API still resolve through
//! [`map_deprecated_agent_type`], which maps each known value to its
//! historical *effective* grant (Explore/Research were read-only; Plan carried
//! bash, so it was write-capable). Unknown values fail closed rather than
//! silently escalating to full write access.
