//! Upgrading a Homebrew-managed install.
//!
//! Homebrew owns the Cellar binary and records which version it believes is
//! installed. Renaming a downloaded binary over it SUCCEEDS, because the prefix
//! is user-owned on Apple Silicon, and then brew's manifest disagrees with the
//! disk until an unrelated `brew upgrade` silently reverts the user. Letting
//! brew do the upgrade keeps the version it reports true (#963).
//!
//! Supervision (#1779). This was the unsupervised branch: children awaited with
//! no wall-clock budget, a reported version that was the GitHub release name
//! fetched BEFORE brew ran, and no restart backstop, so the process exec'd itself
//! into `current_exe()` while brew might still be mutating the Cellar. Now each
//! `brew` child runs under [`BREW_TIMEOUT`] and is killed when it overruns (see
//! [`super::bounded_child`]); the version comes from brew, read back AFTER the
//! upgrade, or none is claimed; and a systemd host arms the same delayed-restart
//! timer the binary-download branch arms.
