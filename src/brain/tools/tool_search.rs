//! `tool_search` — the agent's on-demand tool discovery.
//!
//! In lazy-tools mode the request carries only the CORE schemas plus this
//! tool. When the agent needs anything else (browser, channels, sub-agents,
//! media, system, …) it calls `tool_search("what I need")`; the matching
//! tools are activated for the session (so their schemas ride on subsequent
//! requests) and their full schemas are returned immediately so the agent can
//! act right away. Mirrors `load_brain_file` for contextual brain files.
