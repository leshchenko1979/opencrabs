//! Plan-mode tool gate: the tool-loop enforcement of the Editing
//! write policy and the Active `.md` freeze.
//!
//! Checked on every tool execution (registry choke point). The gate is
//! driven entirely by the MCP-style [`ToolHints`] risk axes: a tool's
//! `read_only` flag is the sole signal. There are no name lists; the
//! hint model is the single source of truth.
//!
//! - **Pre-init Editing** (durable flag, no session `.md` yet):
//!   read-only tools pass; mutators (`read_only = false`) go to
//!   `RequireApproval` so the user can confirm any side effect during
//!   design.
//! - **Post-init Editing** (`.md` + `.json`): read-only tools pass;
//!   writes to the session `.md` pass (the design doc is editable);
//!   all other mutators go to `RequireApproval`.
//! - **Active**: the seed window (between Approve and first `start`)
//!   hard-denies mutators; otherwise the live design `.md` is frozen
//!   against write tools and everything else follows normal approval.
//! - **NoPlan**: no gate.
//!
//! Approval prompts fire only under the `/ask` policy (via
//! `requires_approval`) or user-initiated `/plan` Editing (via this
//! gate's `RequireApproval`). Under yolo (`auto_approve = true`),
//! `requires_approval` never prompts; this gate's `RequireApproval`
//! only fires during Editing, which is entered only when the user hits
//! `/plan` themselves (the interactive-prompt discriminator).
//!
//! Denials return deterministic, instructive strings so the model can
//! navigate to the allowed alternative instead of flailing.
