//! Skill glob gate (issue #150) — the registry-level sibling of
//! `plan_gate`.
//!
//! Cursor-style opt-in enforcement for skills: a `SKILL.md` that declares
//! a `globs:` frontmatter field guards its own topic. When the agent
//! attempts a tool call that references a path matching one of those
//! globs, and the skill body is NOT loaded (seen) in the current session
//! context — fresh sessions AND post-compaction (owner decision
//! 2026-09-10) — the call is rejected. The rejection carries the skill
//! body AND a durable route to the complete text (`gate_block_message`):
//! the harness caps tool output at `DEFAULT_MAX_INLINE_TOOL_BYTES`, so a
//! body larger than the cap reaches the caller as a head/tail preview —
//! which is why the message names the skill's own source file instead of
//! promising a complete body the cap can truncate. The identical retry
//! succeeds either way: the retry is armed before the rejection returns.
//!
//! Laws (design v2, decisions 6–9):
//! - **Fail-open:** any gate-internal error (pattern compile failure,
//!   malformed globs, missing skill file, registry error) → `Pass`. The
//!   gate must never dead-end an agent.
//! - **Opt-in:** no `globs` key → the skill is invisible to the gate.
//! - **Exempt recovery tools** must never be gated, or a blocked agent
//!   cannot self-serve (`load_brain_file`, `read_file`, `slash_command`,
//!   `session_search`, `tool_search`, `write_opencrabs_file`,
//!   `execute_code`).
//! - **Cursor match table:** `*` matches one path segment (never `/`),
//!   `**` matches recursively — `require_literal_separator: true`.
//!   Globs match against the normalized ABSOLUTE path; skill authors
//!   use `**/` prefixes (e.g. `**/skills/opencrabs-dev/**`).
//! - **Pattern resolution** ([`compile_pattern`]): `~` expands to home;
//!   a wildcard-led pattern (`**/x`) is unanchored and matched verbatim;
//!   any other relative pattern anchors at the session cwd. A glob is
//!   never blanket-prefixed with `cwd` — that silently disarms every
//!   documented `**/…` form.
//! - **Cheap + deterministic:** fast-exit when disabled / no loaded
//!   skill declares globs / tool is exempt.
