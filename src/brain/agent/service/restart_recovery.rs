//! Delivery of restart-recovery reports to the session that owns them (#1037).
//!
//! A report about work a previous process was doing must reach the surface
//! that started that work, not whichever surface happened to boot. Two things
//! stand in the way:
//!
//! - Recovery runs during startup, before any channel has called
//!   [`super::session_routes::register_session_route`], so the route map is
//!   empty at the moment the report is produced. Delivering immediately sends
//!   a channel session's report to the local surface, which is the bug #940
//!   fixed for the completion path and the restart path never got.
//! - A channel that never comes up in this run would strand the report
//!   forever if we simply waited for a route.
//!
//! So a report is parked when no route claims its session yet, delivered the
//! moment one does, and flushed to the local surface once the grace period
//! expires. Nothing is dropped on either branch.
