//! What the user gets told while a compaction walks the fallback chain.
//!
//! `complete_compaction_request` reported every step with `tracing` only:
//! a primary timing out after its full attempt budget, the walk moving to
//! the next provider, the chain running dry. After `/compact` the TUI showed
//! one "requested" line, then silence for as long as the chain took, then
//! an error (#1521). The chat path surfaces the same events as alerts.
//!
//! Manual compaction is the case where a person is watching, so it gets
//! every step. Automatic compaction stays quiet on the way and reports only
//! a failure, because a summariser that quietly succeeds is the point of
//! running it in the background.
