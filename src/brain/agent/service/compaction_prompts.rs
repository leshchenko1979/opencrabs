//! Post-compaction continuation prompts.
//!
//! When the loop auto-compacts a session it appends a system message
//! that tells the model how to resume. There are two emission modes:
//!
//! - **Fun** (default): the original POST-COMPACTION PROTOCOL prompts.
//!   They explicitly invite the model to drop a brief, in-character
//!   one-liner ("brain refresh — what was I doing?") before continuing.
//!   Users have flagged these moments as a delight feature — emergent
//!   personality lines, sometimes per-language (e.g. Russian мат in
//!   frustration moments), generate organic shareable screenshots that
//!   read as "this thing has a soul."
//!
//! - **Silent**: tells the model to resume without acknowledging the
//!   compaction at all. Right for formal / corporate / customer-facing
//!   deployments where dropping mid-session profanity is inappropriate.
//!   Selected by setting `[agent] silent_compaction = true` in
//!   `~/.opencrabs/config.toml`.
//!
//! Why a dedicated module: tool_loop.rs already carries the four
//! compaction sites + a lot of other state. Inlining the prompt
//! strings inflates each site and forces every prompt edit to touch
//! the loop. Centralising here keeps both variants side-by-side so
//! anyone editing the fun version is one screen away from the silent
//! mirror — they cannot accidentally drift apart.

/// Which compaction trigger fired. Each kind has a slightly different
/// recovery story (mid-loop edits vs. provider 4xx vs. async budget),
/// so the prompts differ in detail even though the shape is the same.
