//! Background task manager (#722).

//! Runs a genuinely long command detached (so it doesn't churn the bash 600s
//! cap) and, on completion, enqueues a synthetic `QueuedUserMessage` into the
//! originating session via the surface enqueue callback. The tool loop drains
//! that at the next iteration boundary — injected mid-turn if the agent is still
//! working, or starting a fresh turn if it went idle.
