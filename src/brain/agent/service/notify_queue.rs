//! Durable parking for undelivered pushes (#111).
//!
//! Every chokepoint that parks a push in memory (`PARKED` for
//! restart-recovery reports, `pending_reactions` for Telegram mid-turn
//! follow-ups) is wiped by a process kill. The `notify_queue` table is the
//! durable twin: each in-memory park also writes one row, and each consume
//! site clears the matching rows on delivery — the same posture the
//! tombstone persistence (#73) established.
//!
//! Best-effort by design, both directions:
//! - A failed persist costs a loud error log, the push rides the in-memory
//!   queue alone (exactly the pre-#111 behavior).
//! - A failed clear costs a stale row that boot redelivery replays — a
//!   DUPLICATE after restart, never a lost message.
//!
//! `None` before the DB is initialized (early startup, tests) simply means
//! durable parking is skipped, mirroring [`super::restart_recovery`]'s
//! tombstone posture. Entry points are runtime-agnostic: outside a live
//! tokio runtime (sync tests, pre-boot) the work is skipped with a debug
//! log rather than panicking — a sync context cannot await the DB anyway,
//! and the in-memory queue still holds the push.
