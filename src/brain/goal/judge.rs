//! Goal judge — evaluates whether a goal is satisfied after each turn.

use crate::brain::provider::{LLMRequest, Message, Provider};

/// The judge system prompt. Asks a simple yes/no with structured JSON output.
const JUDGE_SYSTEM: &str = r#"You are a goal-evaluation judge. Your ONLY job is to decide whether the assistant's last response satisfies the user's goal.

You will receive:
- The GOAL: what the user wants accomplished
- The LAST RESPONSE: the assistant's most recent output

Respond with ONLY a JSON object (no markdown, no code fences, no extra text):
{
  "verdict": "DONE" or "CONTINUE",
  "reason": "brief explanation of why",
  "corrections": "optional guidance for what the assistant should do next (only if CONTINUE)"
}

Rules:
- DONE: the goal is fully satisfied. The work is complete.
- CONTINUE: the goal is NOT yet fully satisfied. More work is needed.
- Be generous: if the response clearly addresses the goal, say DONE.
- Be strict only when the response is incomplete or wrong.
- If the assistant says it can't do something, that's DONE with reason explaining the block.
- If the response contains errors or the assistant is still mid-task, say CONTINUE.
- Return ONLY the JSON object. Nothing else."#;

/// like reasoning models burning all tokens on CoT.
