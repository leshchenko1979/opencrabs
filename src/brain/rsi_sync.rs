//! RSI Template Sync — Upstream brain file template synchronization.
//!
//! Checks for new releases, fetches updated templates from the public repo,
//! diffs against local brain files, and appends only new sections.
//!
//! State is persisted to `~/.opencrabs/rsi/state.toml`:
//! ```toml
//! last_synced_version = "0.3.14"
//! last_sync_date = "2026-04-27T21:00:00Z"
//!
//! [files]
//! SOUL.md = "2026-04-27T21:00:00Z"
//! TOOLS.md = "2026-04-27T21:00:00Z"
//! ```
//!
//! Flow:
//! 1. Version gate — compare `last_synced_version` to `crate::VERSION`. No change = bail.
//! 2. Backup all tracked files to `rsi/backups/`.
//! 3. Fetch upstream templates from raw GitHub URLs.
//! 4. Diff: extract sections in upstream that don't exist locally.
//! 5. Merge: append new sections. Log to `rsi/improvements.md`.
//! 6. Sanity check: verify file isn't empty. If failed, restore from backup.
//! 7. Update state.
