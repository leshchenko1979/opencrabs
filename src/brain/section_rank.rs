//! BM25 ranking over the sections of a brain file (#996).
//!
//! Separate from `brain_sections`, which owns parsing: that module answers
//! "what are the sections", this one answers "which of them is this message
//! about". Automatic recall needs the second question answered well, because
//! it runs unprompted on every turn and anything it injects competes with the
//! actual task.
//!
//! Counting shared query terms could not do it. Measured against a real
//! 156-section MEMORY.md and 437 real user messages, the hit-count rule fired
//! on 89.5% of them, and every threshold on hit count traded noise against
//! genuine recall roughly one for one. The cause is that `the`, `and`, `you`
//! and `can` all clear the length filter, so two of them co-occurring is true
//! of nearly any section.
//!
//! BM25 fixes the weighting: a term present in most sections contributes
//! almost nothing. Dividing by query length fixes the rest, and it is the part
//! that mattered most. Without it a long message accumulates score from many
//! weak matches, so a fixed threshold behaves like no threshold at all. With
//! it the trade-off finally has a knee.
//!
//! Deliberately no embeddings. They are unavailable when vectors are disabled,
//! when the ~300 MB model download fails, and permanently on a CPU without AVX,
//! so making recall depend on them would give memory that works on one machine
//! and not another. FTS-style lexical ranking needs no model, no network and no
//! particular CPU, which is why the rest of the codebase falls back to it.
