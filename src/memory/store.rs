//! Store — per-profile memory Stores for the memory database.
//!
//! Keyed by resolved database path, NOT a single global (#999). This was one
//! `OnceCell` that captured `opencrabs_home()` on the first call and cached the
//! Store forever. Profiles genuinely switch inside one process: the cron
//! scheduler runs each job inside `with_profile_home_async`, so a job under
//! profile B executed with B's config, keys and brain files while reading and
//! writing profile A's `memory.db`, whichever profile happened to initialize
//! first. Since the turn path indexes MEMORY.md, that wrote one profile's
//! memory into another's index.
//!
//! Profiles are the isolation boundary in this codebase, so the component
//! holding indexed content has to respect it.
