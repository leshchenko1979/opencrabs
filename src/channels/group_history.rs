//! Shared recent-history preamble for multi-party surfaces (#133, #682).
//!
//! Telegram grew this logic first; Discord, Slack and WhatsApp each re-injected
//! their full history window every turn because they never got it (#1618,
//! #1619, #1620). The rendering is identical across surfaces apart from one
//! noun ("group" vs "channel") and the log label, so it lives here once rather
//! than four times.
//!
//! Two independent jobs:
//!
//! 1. **Dedup** against what the live session already holds. After a
//!    compaction the model still has the last N turns in context, so
//!    re-injecting the same messages burns tokens and makes the model answer a
//!    history line instead of the current one.
//! 2. **Framing** (#682), so the block reads as prior context from various
//!    senders rather than as the message being replied to.
