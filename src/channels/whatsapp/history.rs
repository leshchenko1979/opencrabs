//! Bounded WhatsApp history sync (#1525).
//!
//! WhatsApp answers a PDO history request by streaming encrypted sync frames
//! back over the normal socket; the wa crate decrypts them and re-emits the
//! messages through the same event stream, distinguishable only by the
//! per-message markers (`is_offline`, `unavailable_request_id`). Per the
//! decision doc (~/.opencrabs/research/whatsapp-history-sync-decisions-1525.md):
//!
//! - **Store**: the existing `channel_messages` partition the live capture
//!   already uses, keyed by the SAME normalized `chat_id` the live path
//!   formats (#1544), tagged `message_type = "imported"` and deduped by
//!   platform message id.
//! - **Opt-in**: per-chat, OFF by default (`[channels.whatsapp]
//!   history_import_chats`) — a config edit IS the consent gesture, so there
//!   is no global enable and no agent-side write surface.
//! - **Bounds**: hard caps, whichever hits first — 10,000 messages per chat
//!   or 90 days back (the request plan below), plus a window filter at
//!   capture for frames the phone answers outside the range.
//! - **Surface**: read-only search through the `whatsapp_history` tool.
//!
//! The request trigger lives in `agent.rs` (fires on connect); the capture
//! gate lives in `handle_message` (frames must never wake the agent). This
//! module owns only the decisions, as pure functions.
