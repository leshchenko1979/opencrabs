//! The shared [`WhatsAppState`] struct: fields, `new()` and `Default`.
//!
//! Every field is `pub(super)` so the per-concern impl modules beside this
//! file (`approval`, `cancel`, `connection`, `followups`,
//! `onboarding_events`, `pairing`, `photos`, `sessions`) can reach them
//! without widening the crate-visible surface. Behaviour lives there, not
//! here.
