//! Native-flow interactive buttons (#1411).
//!
//! This channel shipped buttons once and removed them: commit 2f15f1d1 tore
//! `ButtonsMessage` out of the approval flow because modern clients silently
//! never render it, and the comment saying so is still in `handler.rs`. So the
//! bar for putting buttons back is higher than "the field exists".
//!
//! `NativeFlowMessage` is a genuinely different path from the one that failed:
//! it rides inside `InteractiveMessage`, which is what WhatsApp's own Business
//! surfaces use, and it is what every current unofficial client sends. That
//! makes it worth trying. It does NOT make it proven - whether a given client
//! draws the card can only be settled by sending one to a real phone. Two
//! consequences shape the code below:
//!
//! * The approval flow keeps its plain-text prompt unless the owner turns
//!   `interactive_buttons` on. An approval prompt that does not render is a
//!   safety-critical message the user cannot answer, so this does not default
//!   to the unproven path.
//! * The body text always carries the same instructions the text-only prompt
//!   would have. A card that renders without its buttons still tells the
//!   reader what to type.
//!
//! Tap parsing is always on, whatever the flag says: it costs nothing, and a
//! tap that arrived is evidence the card rendered.
