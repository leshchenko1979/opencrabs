//! Thread-aware Telegram send helpers.
//!
//! Wraps teloxide's `bot.send_message` / `send_photo` / `send_chat_action`
//! constructors with an `Option<ThreadId>` parameter so forum-topic replies
//! land in the originating topic instead of the group's General chat
//! (issue #130).
//!
//! Each helper returns the underlying teloxide request type, so existing
//! chains (`.parse_mode()`, `.reply_markup()`, `.reply_to_message_id()`,
//! `.await`) continue to work unchanged. The only call-site delta is the
//! function name + an extra `thread_id` argument.
//!
//! `thread_id = None` is a no-op — the helper produces the same request
//! you'd get from `bot.send_message(chat_id, text)` directly. Safe to use
//! everywhere even in non-topic chats.
