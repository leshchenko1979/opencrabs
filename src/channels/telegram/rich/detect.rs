//! Text-structure detection that gates the rich paths.
//!
//! Pure predicates over the reply text: does it contain a table, a task
//! list, an ATX heading, any block structure worth native rich rendering?
//! The gates live together here so the decision surface is one file: the
//! verdict fns ([`should_send_native_rich`], [`should_send_native_rich_for`])
//! log their inputs, and the raw structure probes they compose
//! ([`contains_table`], [`contains_task_list`], [`has_rich_structure`],
//! [`is_atx_heading`]) stay quiet and cheap.
//!
//! Split out of `mod.rs` when it went declarations-only (#1293 era):
//! functions never live in `mod.rs` (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
