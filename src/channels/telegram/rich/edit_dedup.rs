//! Remember what each rich message was last edited to, so we stop asking
//! Telegram to replace a message with itself.
//!
//! The rich edit path re-sends identical content on every refresh. Telegram
//! answers `400: message is not modified`, which the caller logged as a send
//! failure. In one evening of ordinary group use that produced dozens of WARN
//! lines, each one a round trip whose only purpose was to be told nothing had
//! changed, spent against the same budget that was already backing off
//! elsewhere in the session (#1443).
//!
//! The fingerprint covers the reply markup as well as the text, because that
//! is the pair Telegram compares. Hashing the text alone would skip an edit
//! that only swaps a keyboard, which is a real change.
//!
//! A fingerprint is recorded only once an edit has actually landed. Recording
//! at attempt time would let a failed edit convince the next identical attempt
//! that it was redundant, and the message would keep whatever it had.
