//! Mermaid diagram rendering for Telegram rich messages (#1044).
//!
//! Model output frequently carries ```mermaid fences. They are embedded via
//! `sendRichMessage`: the PRIMARY path is the markdown input mode plus the
//! Bot API 10.2 `media` field (`tg://photo?id=` references), which keeps any
//! tables in the message native; the HTML input mode (`<img>`) is the
//! fallback for servers without the `media` field. A broken image URL makes
//! the whole send fail with `RICH_MESSAGE_PHOTO_NO_MEDIA_FOUND`, so before
//! delivery each fence is pre-validated against the renderer (mermaid.ink):
//! the render's PNG bytes are fetched by us and uploaded via multipart
//! (`attach://`), so Telegram never fetches a third-party URL. A request
//! ladder keeps the render inside Telegram's photo box (natural size first,
//! then a proportional 1200px width clamp); anything else degrades to a
//! legible failure block (the renderer's error note plus the original
//! source) instead of killing the message. Pre-validation never panics or
//! hangs; failure paths yield [`MermaidResult::Failed`].
