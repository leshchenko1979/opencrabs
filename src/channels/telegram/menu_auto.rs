//! Solo-owner group auto-registration (#1155).
//!
//! Groups absent from `[channels.telegram.groups]` never receive a scoped
//! command menu (Gap 1), and startup-only registration goes stale on
//! membership changes (Gap 2). This module closes both for the zero-leak
//! case: a group whose only human member is the bot owner gets the full
//! catalog automatically, with no config entry required.
//!
//! Trigger rule (per #1155): *no humans other than the bot owner*. Extra
//! **bots** are ignored entirely — they neither block registration nor
//! receive menus. Zero-leak holds because the catalog is published under a
//! `ChatMember` scope keyed to the owner's `user_id`, invisible to every
//! other account, and eligibility already guarantees no other human is
//! present.
//!
//! Detection needs no subscription change: any first update from an
//! unconfigured group fires evaluation, including the `new_chat_members`
//! service message delivered when the bot itself is added (the join notice
//! in `member_events`). The Bot API has no "list chats the bot is in", so
//! results are cached in [`TelegramState`] until a membership event clears
//! them for re-evaluation.
