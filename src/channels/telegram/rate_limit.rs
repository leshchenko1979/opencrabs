//! The plan card was writing often enough to trip flood control, and the error
//! was logged and dropped. Nothing recorded that the API had asked for a pause,
//! so the next refresh wrote again immediately and each rejected attempt kept
//! the window alive. Observed as roughly twenty create attempts across forty
//! seconds while the countdown ticked 40s down to 3s without ever elapsing.
//!
//! The card is chrome. Skipping an update is strictly better than being
//! throttled into a loop that also spams duplicates into the chat.
