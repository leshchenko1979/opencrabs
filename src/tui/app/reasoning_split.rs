//! Split persisted assistant content back into its chronological segments.
//!
//! The tool loop persists a turn one iteration at a time, each append being a
//! `<!-- reasoning -->` block followed by that iteration's visible text. Reload
//! used to split only on TOOL markers, so a turn that ran no tools collapsed
//! every iteration into ONE assistant message: think, text, think, text became
//! a single row holding all the text and one merged `details` blob.
//!
//! That single row is then the turn's last non-empty assistant message, which
//! makes it the final answer, which the per-turn fold must always show. A
//! reasoning-heavy turn therefore rendered as a wall after a restart while the
//! live view, where each iteration was its own row, had folded it away.
//!
//! Splitting on the reasoning markers restores the live layout, and it works on
//! rows already in the database because it changes no storage format.
//!
//! A marker counts only at the start of a line, which is how the persist
//! path writes every one of them. The model quoting a marker mid-sentence
//! (it reads its own history through `session_search`) used to close a real
//! block early and turn the rest of the reasoning into the answer (#1587).

/// One chronological piece of a persisted assistant message.
