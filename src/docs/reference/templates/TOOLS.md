# TOOLS.md - Tool Definitions

> **Owns:** tool access, skills, routing pointers, build/runtime commands. Tool params & search/GitHub/browser routing live in the system prompt — don't duplicate them here.

## Tool Access — core set + on-demand discovery

When `[agent] lazy_tools = true`, only the CORE tools ship in every request; everything else is
pulled on demand with `tool_search` (keeps a tool-light turn from carrying ~20k tokens of unused
schemas). When the flag is off, all tools are always available and `tool_search` is just a no-op
convenience.

**Core (always available):** `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `hashline_edit`, `bash`,
`ls`, `glob`, `grep`, `web_search`, `exa_search`, `memory_search`, `task`, `context`, `plan`,
`http_client`, `load_brain_file`, `write_opencrabs_file`, `config_tool`, `slash_command`,
`rename_session`, `follow_up_question`, `tool_search`.

**Extended (call `tool_search("…")` to discover + activate):**

| Category | What it covers | Example query |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| `browser` | navigate / click / type / screenshot / eval on live pages | "click a button on a web page" |
| `channels` | Telegram / Discord / Slack / WhatsApp / Trello — send + connect | "send a telegram photo" |
| `agents` | spawn / wait / send-input / close / resume sub-agents, teams | "spawn a sub-agent" |
| `media` | generate / analyze images, analyze video, provider vision | "generate an image" |
| `documents` | generate XLSX (live formulas) / DOCX / PDF / PPTX with branding, parse documents, PDF to images | "create a spreadsheet with formulas" |
| `system` | feedback_record/analyze, self_improve, rebuild, evolve, tool_manage, rsi_proposals | "rebuild from source" |
| `utility` | cron_manage, session_search, channel_search, mission_control_report, a2a_send | "create a cron job" |

Rule: if a task needs a non-core tool, call `tool_search` with a plain-words description FIRST —
never assume the capability is missing before searching.

## What belongs here

Skill pointers, command/tool/skill distinction, profile-aware paths, custom routing rules.

## Skills (load on demand)

| Skill | Command | What it covers |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Browser CDP | `/browser-cdp` | CDP automation, selectors, screenshots |
| Channels | `/channels` | Telegram, Discord, Slack, Trello, WhatsApp setup |
| Dynamic Tools | `/dynamic-tools` | tools.toml format, runtime tool management |
| SocialCrabs | `/socialcrabs` | Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn automation |
| Google CLI | `/gog` | Gmail, Calendar via gog CLI |
| GitHub Workflow | `/github_workflow` | CI/CD, branch protection, release workflow |
| A2A Gateway | `/a2a-gateway` | Agent-to-Agent protocol reference |
| Servers | `/servers` | SSH aliases, Docker containers, Nginx sites |

## Commands vs Tools vs Skills

Tool = function the agent calls (`bash`, `grep`); command = slash shortcut in commands.toml (`/check`); skill = workflow template loaded on demand (`/browser-cdp`).

## Skill `globs:` frontmatter (path-scoped skill gate, #150)

A `SKILL.md` may declare `globs:` so its topic is ENFORCED, not advisory: a tool call referencing a matching path is rejected (with the full skill body in the rejection) when the skill body is not in the current session context (fresh session or after compaction); the identical retry succeeds. Accepted forms — Cursor comma-string `globs: a/**, b.md`, inline flow `globs: [a/**, b.md]`, block list — quotes stripped; `metadata.globs` is ignored.

- **Opt-in per skill:** no `globs` key = invisible to the gate; built-ins ship glob-less.
- **Match:** normalized ABSOLUTE path, case-insensitive, `*` = one segment, `**` = recursive — write `**/` prefixes.
- **Harvested:** `path`/`file_path`/`filePath` + path-like tokens in bash `command`; `grep`/`glob` tool `pattern`s never are.
- **Exempt (recovery) tools:** `load_brain_file`, `read_file`, `slash_command`, `session_search`, `tool_search`, `write_opencrabs_file`, `execute_code` — a blocked agent must be able to re-arm itself.
- **Sub-agents:** gated too (shared registry path) — one extra blocked round-trip per matching skill per fresh sub-agent.
- **Fail-open law:** any gate-internal error passes the call through; malformed globs WARN once and are skipped.
- **Master switch:** `[agent] skill_glob_gate = true` (default) in config.toml.

## Build & Runtime Commands

- `/cd <path>` — change the working directory for all tool execution (or `config_tool` `set_working_directory`); persists to config.toml
- `/rebuild` — Build, test, and hot-restart from source
- `/check` — Run `cargo clippy` and `cargo test`
- `/evolve` — Download latest release binary (full procedure → BOOT.md)

## Scheduling (Cron)

Manage scheduled jobs with the **`cron_manage`** tool (`action`: create/list/delete/enable/disable/test). Jobs run in isolated sessions on your configured provider/model by default; set `thinking: off` for routine jobs; `deliver_to` sends results to a channel.

**Cron expression format (the common trap):** 5 fields `min hour dom mon dow`. Day-of-week is **1-7 = Sun-Sat** (1=Sunday, 7=Saturday; `0` is invalid) — **use day names** (`Mon-Fri`, `Sun`) instead of numbers. No `@daily`/`@hourly` macros. Set `tz` (IANA, e.g. `America/New_York`) and the job runs in that zone's local time, DST-aware. **Validate before you confirm:** `create` echoes the next run times — read them back; a wrong day-of-week parses fine but the next-run list exposes it. Fix and recreate before telling the user it's set.

## Voice & Audio

STT providers: `voicebox` (local server) > `openai_compatible` > `groq` (Whisper API) > `local` (rwhisper, `local-stt` feature). Override with `stt_fallback_chain`.
TTS providers: `voicebox` (local server) > `openai_compatible` > `openai` (OpenAI TTS) > `local` (Piper, `local-tts` feature). Override with `tts_fallback_chain`.
Config: `[providers.stt.*]` / `[providers.tts.*]`. Piper voices: `ryan`(default), `amy`, `lessac`, `kristin`, `joe`, `cori`. Local STT presets: `local-tiny`(42MB)…`local-medium`(1.5GB). Audio: OGG/Opus via ffmpeg. Models: `~/.local/share/opencrabs/models/{whisper,piper}/`. Setup: `/onboard:voice`.

## Reporting

- `/mission-control`: analytics (tool usage, failure rates, RSI improvements, brain files), activity feed, inbox proposals, scheduled cron jobs. Works in the TUI and every channel; also available as the `mission_control_report` agent tool ("send me my analytics").
