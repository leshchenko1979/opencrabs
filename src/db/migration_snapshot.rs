//! Pre-migration image snapshot (#1779).
//!
//! A migration is a *write*. When the image already carries damage, the
//! migration turns a readable-but-broken database into a destroyed one: the
//! rpi5 incident (arfonzo, 2026-09-27) lost every cron row because `/evolve`
//! restarted the daemon, `run_migrations` ran `ALTER TABLE` against a torn
//! page 1, and the only copy of the data was the file being overwritten.
//!
//! So: copy the whole image *before* anything touches it, and refuse to
//! migrate when that copy cannot be made. A failed snapshot on a non-empty
//! database means the image is either unreadable or the disk is unusable, and
//! both cases migrating is the worst possible next action.
//!
//! Retention is 7 dated copies (owner directive 2026-09-28: "rolling 7 days"),
//! plus one stable `-latest` name so a message, a script or a panicked user can
//! always point at exactly one file instead of globbing for the newest.
