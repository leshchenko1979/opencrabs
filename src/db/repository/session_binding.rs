//! Session Binding Repository
//!
//! Persists which channel (and chat / forum topic) owns each session so a
//! restart can re-register delivery routes at channel-connect time instead
//! of waiting for the next inbound message (#1224). A session idle at boot
//! has no way to reach ingress: without this record every background-task
//! completion and sub-agent result parks until a human pokes the topic.
