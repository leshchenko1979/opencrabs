//! database that was stamped N by the first branch's build skips the other
//! branch's migration forever: the stamp says done, so `to_latest` never

//! missing on a database stamped 38, and with it every restart-recovery row
//! for three days: the INSERT failed on every turn and boot found nothing to
//! resume.
//!
//! A heal is idempotent and checks the schema, not the stamp. It runs after
//! `to_latest` on every boot, so a healed database stays healed and a
