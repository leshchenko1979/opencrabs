//! The periodic embedding backfill decides correctly when to run (#1069).
//!
//! Embedding happened at startup and on write, and neither retries. A backfill
//! that failed for a transient reason left the vector table at zero until
//! someone restarted the process, with no error surfaced: search quietly
//! degraded to keyword-only FTS and kept answering.
//!
//! What is exercised here is the sweep's decision logic, not the embedding
//! call. That call is network-bound on the API path and loads a GGUF model on
//! the local one, so a test that drives it end to end would prove the endpoint
//! is up rather than that the sweep is correct. Stated rather than hidden.
