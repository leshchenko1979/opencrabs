//! Regression for #1522: persisted ledgers and reasoning blocks are cleaned
//! from loaded rows for every provider, CLI providers included.
//!
//! A session at ~168K on an API provider jumped to ~705K on switching to
//! claude-cli and the first request was refused as too long. Both loaded
//! the same 85 rows after the compaction marker; the API path counted them
//! at 141K tokens, the CLI path at 679K. The loader stripped the
//! `<!-- tools-v2 -->` replay ledgers and `<!-- reasoning -->` blocks for
//! API providers only, under a comment claiming the CLI subprocess never
//! saw that content. The CLI prompt builder flattens every text block
//! verbatim, so it saw all of it: of 2.6M characters, 1.9M were ledgers and
//! 0.4M were reasoning.
