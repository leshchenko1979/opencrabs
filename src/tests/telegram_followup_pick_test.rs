//! A tapped follow-up is recorded on its own block, not spoken by the bot (#844).
//!
//! Tapping a suggestion posted a new message containing the chosen text. The
//! Bot API has no send-as-user, so that bubble carries the bot's name, avatar
//! and badge, and a continuation the user chose reads as the bot saying it.
//!
//! #787 tried to fix this by prefixing the echo with a `>` quote. Quote
//! formatting sits inside a bubble that is still labelled as the bot, so the
//! attribution did not change. The block is now edited in place instead, which
//! reads as a selected control and drops the keyboard at the moment the rest of
//! the options stop working.
//!
//! Fixtures are synthetic and carry no user identifiers.
