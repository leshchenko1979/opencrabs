//! The Homebrew evolve branch is supervised: brew's children are bounded, killed
//! when they overrun, and the version the user is told is read back from brew
//! after the upgrade (#1779).
//!
//! These are the spawning half of that work: a real child that really hangs, and
//! a stub `/bin/sh` playing brew. The wording and source pins that go with it
//! live in `evolve_homebrew_reporting_test.rs`, and the systemd arg lists in
//! `evolve_systemd_restart_test.rs`.
//!
//! What we DON'T test: real systemd interaction and a real Homebrew install.
//! Neither exists on macOS runners, and `arm_systemd_backstop` is private on
//! purpose so no test can reach for it by accident.
//!
//! Every test here is unix-only: the stubs are `/bin/sh` scripts and
//! `PermissionsExt` does not exist on Windows.
