//! Nested config paths resolve to their top-level section (#889).
//!
//! Config is nested but `config_manager` rendered only the first level, so the
//! paths people actually write were rejected. Every recorded failure was one of
//! `providers.stt`, `stt` or `telegram` — the real shapes in config.toml.
//!
//! RSI had already tried to patch this from the other end by writing a brain
//! rule listing the valid names. That is guidance papering over an interface
//! gap: the rule decays, accepting the path does not.
//!
//! Fixtures are synthetic and carry no user identifiers.
