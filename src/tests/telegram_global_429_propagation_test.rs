//! A 429 learned anywhere reaches the process-wide cooldown (#1630).
//!
//! The global lock is only worth having if every path that recognises a 429
//! arms it. As merged, `record_global_429` was called from `wait_out` alone,
//! so a throttle discovered on a plan-card write or a queued final stayed
//! private to that one path and every other chat walked into the same wall.
//!
//! These drive the real failure handlers rather than re-deriving their
//! reasoning: each asserts the global deadline moved, which is the fact the
//! rest of the process reads.
