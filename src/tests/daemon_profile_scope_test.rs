//! Daemon profile scoping and adoption guard ordering (#1723).
//!
//! Two contracts:
//! 1. A `-p <name>` daemon is scoped to THAT profile: it adopts nothing.
//!    Cross-profile adoption is a default-launch behavior. The scoping
//!    decision and the candidate filter are pinned by pure unit tests
//!    against a TempDir instance-lock dir.
//! 2. A losing scheduler adopter (profile owned by another process) must
//!    not write the foreign profile's home. The brain seed happens AFTER
//!    the lock is won, so a denied adopter leaves the foreign home
//!    untouched. Verified against a probe-named profile: on correct code
//!    the test writes NOTHING anywhere; the probe profile dir under the
//!    real base stays absent (or, if a previous mutant created it, stays
//!    template-free is NOT asserted; what is asserted is absence of the seed marker).
