//! Tests for the #1152 fix: a final suppressed by intermediate-dedup must
//! NOT have its trailing folded run reclaimed as an orphan fragment.
//!
//! Incident: dedup suppressed the 1484-char final (it matched an already
//! delivered intermediate bubble), then the unconditional #478 reclaim
//! popped whatever trailing folded run remained — a 62-char tail chunk —
//! and delivered it as a raw orphan bubble below the full answer.
//!
//! The fix gates reclaim on the `suppressed_final` flag instead of trying
//! to re-verify coverage with `folded_duplicates_final`, because streaming
//! can leave a SUFFIX chunk folded in the block and that predicate
//! deliberately matches prefix overlap only. The tests below pin both
//! facts plus the exact strip semantics of `pop_trailing_folded_texts`.
