//! The correction injected when a turn claims work it never ran (#796, #797).
//!
//! The old wording stated what was missing ("your last response produced ZERO
//! tool_use blocks"), which argues against a position the model does not hold.
//! A model that believes it already ran `gh issue list` reads that as a
//! formatting complaint and keeps the belief. These pin the wording that
//! replaces it: the mechanism, and a check the model can actually apply.
//!
//! Fixtures are synthetic and carry no user identifiers.
