//! Structured completion reports are never discarded (#1506).
//!
//! Every phantom detector matches verbatim strings — intent phrases, quoted
//! commands, sha/tally tokens — and a distilled turn summary paraphrases by
//! construction. On 2026-09-10 four legitimate batch reports (1.8-2.0 KB,
//! markdown tables included, every fact real) were killed by the mid-loop
//! self-heal: `StripStreamedContent` drained the streamed report and the
//! retry produced a shortened rewrite. The owner's standing directive: a
//! report with tables and structured data must NEVER be discarded.
//!
//! The fix is two-part in `tool_loop`'s kill block: (1) the ten detector
//! branches hoist into a named `fired_branches` list so the WARN attributes
//! exactly what fired — previously unattributable, per the read-only audit;
//! (2) `is_structured_report` exempts the genre from the discard wholesale,
//! with the fired branches logged for forensics.
//!
//! Deliberate trade-off, owner-ruled: #1423's fabricated table report would
//! now be delivered instead of discarded, with a WARN trail instead of
//! silence. The zero-tool turn-end verdict (#752) and every prose-shaped
//! detector keep full authority.
//!
//! Fixtures are synthetic and carry no user identifiers.
