//! Regression guards for #1635.
//!
//! Two defects shipped together and reinforced each other:
//!
//! 1. Every OpenAI-compatible provider built its HTTP client with a 60s total
//!    request timeout. reqwest's `.timeout()` covers the response body read, so
//!    it is a hard wall-clock ceiling on an SSE stream no matter how many chunks
//!    are still arriving. Anthropic and Gemini already used 300s, which is why
//!    only the compat providers (every custom endpoint, i.e. every cheap
//!    thinking-heavy fallback model) died at exactly 60.0s mid-stream.
//!    #1635 raised the number to 300s, which moved the wall. #1687 took it off
//!    the stream path altogether: the total now bounds non-streaming calls only,
//!    and `the_stream_clients_carry_no_total_timeout` below pins that it never
//!    comes back.
//! 2. The stream-retry log lines hardcoded `3` while `MAX_STREAM_RETRIES` is 5,
//!    emitting `Stream retry 5/3 failed` and `All 3 stream retries failed`. That
//!    made the retry budget look smaller than it is and sent the first reading
//!    of the incident down the wrong path entirely.
