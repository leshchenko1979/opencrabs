//! `opencrabs service install` on Linux: a root (sudo) install must produce a
//! *system* unit that runs as the invoking user and starts on boot, while a
//! non-root install produces a plain *user* unit. (The bus-failure handling and
//! honest exit-status reporting live in `run_systemctl`, which shells out to
//! systemctl and so is validated on the box, not here.)
//!
//! Every generated unit must also carry `OOMPolicy=continue`. The daemon is the
//! parent of every tool call and cron child, and systemd's default policy
//! (`stop`) terminates the whole unit when any single child is OOM-killed —
//! turning one tool call's memory spike into a full daemon restart.
