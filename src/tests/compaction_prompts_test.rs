//! Tests for `agent::service::compaction_prompts`.
//!
//! Regression context (2026-05-29): a Telegram user (leshchenko1979)
//! forwarded a post-compaction one-liner — the model dropping into
//! Russian мат when expressing frustration after recovering context —
//! to friends, calling it a "Skynet" moment. Earlier we had silenced
//! all post-compaction narration via commit fb325fb5; this test
//! locks in that the fun variant is the DEFAULT (so those delight
//! moments keep happening) and that the silent variant is reachable
//! when `[agent] silent_compaction = true`.
//!
//! These tests are deliberately string-sentinel based, not full
//! equality. The exact wording will drift; what must not drift is:
//!
//! - Default (silent=false) keeps the explicit "POST-COMPACTION
//!   PROTOCOL" header and at least one invitation to acknowledge.
//! - Silent (silent=true) keeps the explicit "Silently" directive
//!   and excludes the fun acknowledgement invitation.
//! - The auto-approve tail is appended in both modes when
//!   auto_approve=false.
