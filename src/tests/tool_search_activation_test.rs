//! A searched tool must become callable, not merely described (#1025).
//!
//! `tool_search` returned schemas as TEXT and never activated them, leaving
//! activation to the JIT-on-execute path — which only fires when a non-core
//! tool is actually USED. That is circular: a model that will not emit a call
//! for a function absent from its tool list can never trigger the activation
//! that would list it.
//!
//! Observed on a model that searched for `spawn_agent`, reported "Spawn tool
//! active", then emitted `bash(echo "spawning subagent")` and `read_file`
//! instead — 30 tool calls across two runs, both killed by the
//! announcement-loop detector. Removing the spawn from the task made it
//! complete immediately.
