//! #1634: a theme switch must drop the pre-styled render cache.
//!
//! `render_cache` stores `Line`s whose spans already carry resolved colours,
//! keyed only by (message id, width). Nothing in `theme::set` could reach them,
//! so a live `/theme` repainted the widgets that call `theme::role` every frame
//! (title, borders, the picker itself) and left every message already on screen
//! wearing the previous palette until an unrelated resize happened to clear the
//! cache. That is why switching themes looked like it changed "almost nothing":
//! the transcript, which is most of the screen, was frozen.
//!
//! `theme::set` now bumps a generation counter and `render_chat` compares it
//! against the one the cache was filled under. These tests drive that counter
//! directly rather than calling `theme::set`, because the active theme is
//! process-global and the parallel harness runs one sanctioned mutator test
//! (`tui_theme_presets_test::set_and_reset_switch_active_theme`); a second
//! mutator would race it.
//!
//! Reading it races that mutator too: the counter is process-wide, so its
//! eleven bumps can land between an `App` capturing the live generation and
//! this module asserting the two still agree. Every test here therefore takes
//! `theme_global_lock` before touching the counter, and takes it *after* its
//! async setup so the guard never spans an `.await`.
