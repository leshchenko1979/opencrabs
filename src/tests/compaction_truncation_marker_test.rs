//! A context that shrank must always leave a marker behind.
//!
//! Dropping the oldest messages advances the live context but not the DB.
//! `messages_from_last_compaction` keeps looking at the previous anchor, so a
//! restart reloads exactly the history that just overflowed and overflows
//! again on the first turn. Two sessions died that way on 2026-05-05 (397%
//! and 372% context with 793k tokens still on disk, a fresh loop on every
//! user message). A marker carrying no summary is lossy; no marker at all is
//! unrecoverable, so the truncation path now returns an outcome of its own
//! rather than `None`.
