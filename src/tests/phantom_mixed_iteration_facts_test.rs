//! A fabrication that rode a real tool call was never checked (#1693).
//!
//! Observed 2026-09-22 19:14:10, session `a58b8714`, one response, two content
//! blocks: text asserting `Gate died on 2× E0603 "this item is private"`, and a
//! `bash` call whose command was `arch -arm64 cargo clippy -p opencrabs
//! --all-features --tests` — the gate it had just claimed was dead. The log
//! records `Found 1 tool uses to execute`, so `tool_uses.len() == 1` and the
//! entire 1,341-line phantom block behind `if tool_uses.is_empty()` was skipped.
//! The clippy receipt it referred to reads `clippy exit=0`.
//!
//! Two independent gaps had to line up for that sentence to reach the user, and
//! the issue as first filed named only one of them:
//!
//! 1. **Reach.** Every fact check lived inside the zero-tool branch.
//! 2. **Extraction.** No existing extractor recognises a rustc diagnostic code.
//!    `asserted_shas` needs a run of at least seven hex characters and `E0603`
//!    is five; `asserted_tallies` knows only `passed` / `failed` / `ignored`;
//!    `claims_unbacked_evidence` needs three evidence-shaped lines; and
//!    `claims_uncalled_commands` needs a backticked command with an
//!    already-executed framing. Opening the gate alone would therefore have
//!    evaluated the incident text and found nothing to check.
//!
//! Fixtures are synthetic and carry no user identifiers. The incident fixture
//! uses only the clause the log preview attests verbatim — the full iteration
//! was 118 characters and the tail is not recoverable from the log.
