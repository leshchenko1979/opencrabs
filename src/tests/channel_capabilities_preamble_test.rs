//! Channel capabilities preamble (#1773, port of fork #295 with the fork
//! #513 fence fix folded in).
//!
//! What is pinned here and why:
//!
//! 1. **Placement + idempotence.** The injected block lands before
//!    `--- Runtime Info ---` (or appends when absent), and re-injection is a
//!    no-op. A duplicated block would re-bill tokens on every turn.
//! 2. **The fence example must be one the renderer accepts (#513).** The
//!    mermaid resolvers trim the fence info string and accept EXACTLY
//!    `mermaid` (src/utils/mermaid.rs:95,144; telegram rich mermaid
//!    :1123). An example like "```mermaid vertical" ships the diagram as an
//!    ordinary code fence: no render, no image, and no error.
//! 3. **The loader stays channel-agnostic.** Channel awareness is a
//!    per-session runtime decision; one process serves Telegram, Discord,
//!    Slack and cron alike, so the startup brain must carry no block.
//! 4. **The #1773 directive rides both blocks.** A channel user has no
//!    filesystem: research/report files must be attached to the channel,
//!    not just named.
//! 5. **Survival across compaction.** Upstream welds nothing onto the
//!    summary (#1649/#1676) because `system_brain` survives compaction
//!    untouched: that property is asserted here, so a future compaction
//!    rework cannot silently drop the block.
