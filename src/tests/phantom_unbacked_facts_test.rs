//! A report's facts must exist somewhere in the conversation (#1423).
//!
//! The post-success exemption lets a text-only iteration through once the turn
//! has real work behind it, on the reasoning that `Pushed.` is an
//! acknowledgement rather than a claim. That holds for an ack and fails for a
//! report. Observed 2026-09-07 01:35:59: 24 successful tool calls, then a
//! 4,664-character iteration exempted as a "pure completion acknowledgement"
//! while asserting test tallies and commit shas that no tool had printed.
//!
//! Length cannot discriminate. Across 128 exempted iterations over three days
//! the median is 968 characters and p90 is 2,563, so most exempted text is
//! legitimately long and a size bound would re-break the regression the
//! exemption was added for. What separates a report from a fabrication is
//! whether the facts in it exist.
//!
//! `claims_unbacked_evidence` was the branch that should have caught it and is
//! shape-gated: it needs three lines shaped like a grep dump, an `===` frame,
//! padded key-value or a column row. A markdown table with prose between the
//! rows matches none of them, which is how the fabrication walked through.
//!
//! Fixtures are synthetic and carry no user identifiers.
