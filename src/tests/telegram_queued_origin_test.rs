//! A detached result queued during final delivery must not be answered by the
//! toolless flush (#1213).
//!
//! `try_begin_turn` covers the whole delivery window, not just the tool loop,
//! so a background command finishing after the loop exits is classified
//! "in-flight turn" and queued. Nothing drains it between rounds, because
//! there are no more rounds. The only remaining consumer was the #302 Stage-2
//! leftover flush, which answers through `send_message_with_display`: one
//! provider round, no tool registry. Right-sized for an emoji acknowledgement,
//! structurally wrong for a result the agent is expected to act on — the model
//! announced follow-up work it had no tools to perform, and the session went
//! quiet until the user pinged it.
