//! Auto-compaction runs in the background, and the three things that makes
//! dangerous are covered here.
//!
//! 1. **The gap.** A summariser that blocks the turn cannot miss anything:
//!    nothing arrives while it runs. A backgrounded one leaves a gap, and
//!    everything in that gap is the most recent work the agent did. The swap
//!    has to keep it.
//! 2. **The ceiling.** When the context outgrows its headroom the turn waits
//!    for the summary instead of discarding it. Cancelling to reclaim room is
//!    what left a truncated context with no marker and looped two sessions on
//!    reload (2026-05-05), so the predicate that decides to wait is asserted
//!    directly rather than inferred.
//! 3. **The notice.** The gate is re-entered on every tool iteration, so an
//!    announcement placed above the dispatch repeats for a compaction that is
//!    already running (#1686). The predicate deciding to announce, and the
//!    order that puts it below the guard, are both asserted here.
