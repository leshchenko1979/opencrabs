//! Scope cron jobs so they may send only to their configured targets.
//!
//! A cron job runs with no channel origin: nothing binds its session to a
//! chat. The proactive send path resolves a destination from the tool input
//! first, and a job's turn can pick that input up from anywhere it reads,
//! including a recalled memory. On 2026-08-21 a memory note from two weeks
//! earlier recorded a chat id and thread id under the heading "CONTINUE THIS
//! TASK", and a job posted its report into that group — one it was never
//! configured for, whose members had asked nothing.
//!
//! The rule this enforces: a cron turn may send only to the target its job was
//! created with. With no target it sends to no channel at all, and its output
//! lives in its own session. Recalled text can shape what a report says; it can
//! never decide where the report goes.
//!
//! #148 extends this across all channel authorities (telegram, discord,
//! slack, whatsapp), matching the central resolver's authority grammar.
