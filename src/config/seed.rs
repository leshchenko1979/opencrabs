//! Materialise the shipped example files when they are absent.
//!
//! `config.toml.example` carries a section for every provider, disabled, with
//! its options documented inline. That file is how a provider setting gets
//! changed by hand: find the section, edit the value, save. It only serves
//! that purpose if it reaches disk.
//!
//! It used to reach disk from exactly one place, a single onboarding step,
//! guarded on `config.toml` not already existing. Meanwhile two other paths
//! created the file without it: a `write_key` for any section at all built its
//! document from nothing, and a startup auto-generate serialised the in-memory
//! config over the top. Whichever ran first won permanently, because the
//! seeding guard only ever fires once, and a user left holding the loser has a
//! config with no provider sections in it and nothing to edit.
//!
//! Seeding is not a wizard step, it is what the file needs before anyone
//! writes to it, so it lives here and every creator goes through it.
