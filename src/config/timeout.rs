//! Timeout flag resolution (#1688).
//!
//! Every timeout flag resolves through one chain:
//!
//! ```text
//! [providers.<name>]  ->  [agent]  ->  the family's compiled default
//! ```
//!
//! Before this, `timeout_secs` and `stream_idle_timeout_secs` were read in
//! exactly one place — `factory.rs`, inside `configure_openai_compatible` — and
//! against exactly one tier: the per-provider struct. A key set under `[agent]`
//! was parsed, stored, and silently ignored, and the two non-compat families
//! (`anthropic`, `gemini`) ignored both keys at every tier (#1689). The same
//! flag therefore meant three different things depending on which family a
//! provider happened to belong to, which is the shape of bug #1687 was filed
//! against.
//!
//! The resolution is deliberately pure: it takes the two configured values and
//! the family's compiled floor and returns what applies plus which tier said
//! so. No `Config::current()`, no disk, no globals — so precedence is testable
//! without a config file anywhere. The callers in `factory.rs` are the thin
//! edge that feeds it real values.
