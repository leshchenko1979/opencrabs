//! The set of real config sections, and what a write may address (#1199, #83).
//!
//! Reads and writes disagreed about what a section is. The read path resolves
//! shorthand (`stt` -> `providers`) against a registry; the write path
//! accepted any dotted string and created whatever tables it named. A caller
//! that passed `opencode` instead of `providers.opencode` got `Ok(())`, an
//! orphan `[opencode]` table at the end of `config.toml`, and a value serde
//! discards on every load. Reads then keep reporting the old value, which
//! looks exactly like a stale cache.
//!
//! #83 made the compiled struct the source of truth. A hand-maintained list
//! had drifted twice already: `CONFIG_SECTIONS` missed eight real sections
//! (daemon, a2a, image, cron, memory, brain, browser, doctor) and still
//! listed the migrated-away `[voice]`; `KNOWN_TOP_LEVEL_KEYS` missed
//! `doctor`. Both lists are gone. The write guard and the loader's typo
//! warning deserialize the document through `Config` with `serde_ignored` and
//! act on the ignored-key paths: the struct knows `[memory]`, so a write to
//! it passes; a path the struct would discard on load is refused outright,
//! keeping the #1199 silent-no-op hole closed at every depth, not just the
//! top level.
//!
//! The registry lives here rather than in the config tool because both sides
//! need it and `config` cannot depend on `brain::tools`.
